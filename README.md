# FamousPeople

This repository contains **Earthio**, a small demo website showing an
interactive globe. Each country on the globe links to a famous person
determined by Wikipedia page view counts using the Wikimedia API.

The data can be regenerated with:

```bash
node docs/generateFamousPeople.js
```

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to explore the globe or enable
GitHub Pages in your repository settings and select the **docs/**
folder as the source to publish the site online.
